/**
 * A Simple Solution is to traverse nodes in Inorder and one by one insert into
 * a self-balancing BST like AVL tree. Time complexity of this solution is O(n
 * Log n) and this solution doesn’t guarantee
 * 
 * 
 * An Efficient Solution can construct balanced BST in O(n) time with minimum
 * possible height. Below are steps.
 * 
 * Traverse given BST in inorder and store result in an array. This step takes
 * O(n) time. Note that this array would be sorted as inorder traversal of BST
 * always produces sorted sequence. Build a balanced BST from the above created
 * sorted array using the recursive approach discussed here. This step also
 * takes O(n) time as we traverse every element exactly once and processing an
 * element takes O(1) time.
