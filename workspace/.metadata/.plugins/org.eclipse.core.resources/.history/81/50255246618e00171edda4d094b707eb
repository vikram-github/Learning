Multi-Tasking

1. Executing multiple tasks in a given time


Process Based Multi-Tasking
	-Executing several tasks simultaneously. Where each task is procress
	- IDE, Listening to Music etc
Thread Based Multi-Tasking 
	- Threads
	
Advantage - 
	- To increase Performance
	- To reduce idle time / response time of system
	
Java Program will have only one thread but internally it might have daemon threads

If multiple threads are there which threads will execute will be taken care by the thread scheduler. And this depends on the JVM

Invoking run method will not trigger threads

start() is responsible for registering the thread with thread scheduler
